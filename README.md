# Abstract
Embryogenesis is difficult to study and therefore still not fully understood. Yet, a novel approach borrowed from immune biology may provide the necessary tools to embryo research in the scope of an interdisciplinary application.
Tissue restricted antigens are utilized by the immune system for the production of t-cells to prevent autoreactive events. Therefore, they are expressed simultaneously with other genes in the corresponding tissue. Tissue specific antigens seem to be a promising biological indicator to depict the intensity of gene expression to a given time during tissue development. 
Such markers would be a useful method to not only further analyse and understand embryogenesis and organogenesis but inspect general tissue development with high accuracy.

This project aims to explore embryogenesis in mice by analysing the expression levels of tissue restricted antigens over time and summarizing these findings in an applicable dataframe.

**Table 1: Most differentially expressed genes from each developmental stage.** Several tissue types are mentioned with each plot and coloured according to their tissue classification, showing an expression profile of the most prominently expressed TRAs during embryogenesis.
